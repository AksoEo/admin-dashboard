/// Renders a detail view.
///
/// This opens a connection to a core data view and optionally to a core task to edit the data.
///
/// # Props
/// - view: data view name. The data view should expect an `id` option.
///   The view may use the `extra` field and pass `'delete'` to trigger onDelete.
/// - editing/onEndEdit: editing state
/// - onCommit: should commit and end edit (or not, if the user cancels the task).
///   will be passed an array of changed field ids
/// - edit/onEditChange: editing copy. Is not necessarily synchronized with `editing`
/// - id: detail view id
/// - options: additional view options; will *not* cause a reload on update
/// - fields: object { [client field id]: field spec }, with field spec being an object:
///    - component: field editor component { value, onChange, editing, item }
///    - isEmpty: field value => bool
/// - header: like a field editor component, but without value, and with onItemChange
/// - footer: like header
/// - locale: object { fields: { field names... } }
/// - makeHistoryLink: if set, should be a callback that returns the url for the given fieldâ€™s
///   history
/// - onDelete: called when the item is deleted
/// - userData: arbitrary user data passed to fields
/// - onData: will be called with data when it loads
/// - wideExtra: bool, if true will make extra space wider
